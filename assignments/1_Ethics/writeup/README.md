### Part 2 (75 pts)

There are multiple directions comeone could go with this specific situation. If i were thrust into this situation, even if it means that the new car's release is pushed back another six months, I would feel obligated to tell my superior, whether he/she is my boss or my supervisor. It is is my belief that the safety and well-being of the consumer is far more important than any amount of money that could be gained by releasing the car as is. If the company I am working for decides to not do anything with the informationI have supplied them, I would first go to a consumer watchdog and tell them about my findings. If the companystill reuses to budge on the issue. I would take my concerns to the public, even if it meant losing my job. However, to some people, the amount of money gained would be an adequate counter weight to the possible harm that could be caused. They may even argure that there is no way that anyone who doesn't work for the company could possibly know about it. To that, I say, you can never rule out the possibility that somone will not find the errors, If someone ever did, and sued, all the money and more would go down the drainbecause the company would be drowing in lawsuits from the angry consumers. So, in my eyes, it is far easier to fix the problem before it becomes a problem, which will save a lot more money than the alternative. If I were to do nothing with the information, I would feel responsible for all of those affected by the errors I have knowledge of because I am in the position to be able to do something about it and to stop it from happening.
