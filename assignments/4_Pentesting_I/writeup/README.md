## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)
{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

nc 1337bank.money 1337
; find . -name "*flag*"
; cd home && cat flag.txt

After performing a proof of concept on the server to make sure it was vulnerable to command injection, I knew my next goal was to find the flag. Instead of having to go through each file, in each directory, I decided to use a simpler approach. I believed that since in homework 2, the target file was called flag.txt, I decided to look for a linux command that could do the hard work for me. This lead me to using the find linux command to look for any file that had the word flag in the name. This showed me that there was a file that was located in the home directory called flag.txt. After that was done, I realized that I could only perform one command before being kicked out of the server, so I decided that my best chance of getting the contents of the file was to simultaneously change my directory to the home directory and cat the desired flag.txt file that was located therein.

In order to protect from further attacks like this, Elizabeth would have to whitelist and blacklist certain words or letters in the input. All input to the command line that has not been previously validated must be examined to ensure it meets the expectations of the system.
