### Part 2 (60 Pts)

For the first level, all I had to do was surround the alert message in script tags. The second level wasn't a lot more difficult. I just made up an img source and on error gave the alert. Because I couldn't input anything except in the url, I decided that i would stick with on error and put the alert. The fourth level was significantly trickier than the ones before it. I noticed in the code how they called startTimer() and decided to use different iterations to try and get it to work. Eventually, I worked out that I could use the url again and have encoded semicolons. Since there was only a link, I looked to see how it worked and noticed next = confirm. So i changed that to javascript:alert(). Lastly, for level 6, it was a little too difficult. I was not able to figure it out and ended up using a solution online.
